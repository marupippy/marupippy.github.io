### Hello, I am Van

I’m a self-taught designer who’s really into questioning how things happen and figuring out how to understand the troubles. I have a lot of thoughts and love soup!
I am a UX designer based in Italy and Vietnam. Having many years experienced in customer service helps me with strong communication skills and a keen ability to empathize. Before jumpping in to the rabbit hole named “Human-centered design”, I designed wooden structure house in Japan and operated tour in Vietnam.The same things between those jobs are understanding and solving customer's trouble then make them happy with my products and my services.
