### The Problem

Everything we do makes an impact. LOOK FOR SAFE & ETHICAL FARMING PRACTICES. You would support your local farmer when buying organic produce. Conventionally grown flowers are treated much in the same way as non-organic fruits and vegetables—and the negative consequences of toxic chemicals reaches far and wide.

### The Goal

Design a friendly to users to order Organic flowers without coming to the market or the shop.

### Responsibilities

Conducting interviews, paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, iterating on designs, determining information architecture, and responsive design.

## Design Process

###  1. EMPATHIZE

I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better understand their needs. I discovered that many target users care about organic flowers. However, they can not find a typical flower shop like that, and they can not find the option to delivery flowers. 

#### User pain points

- Experience
    *No website to order organic flowers*
- Navigation
    *Be overwhelm to the interaction from the big flowers website.*
- Interaction
    *Shipping fee from international website is expensive*

#### Personas & problem statements

Hannah is professional makeup artist in Paris. She wants to send a special bouquet of flowers for her mother. Hannah is so frustrated with the old fashioned flower shop and their websites to order either to pay.

###  2. DEFINE

#### User journey map

I created a user journey map of Hannah’s experience using the site to help identify possible pain points and improvement opportunities.

#### Information Architecture

I want to create a simple and effective for the users to order delivery organic flowers.
I focus on how I can navigate the users easy and minimal. Using the insights as well as our user needs defined earlier, I created a sitemap for ideating the site.

###  3. IDEATE

#### Paper wireframe screen size variations

I started to work on designs for additional screen sizes to make sure the site would be fully responsive. 
In this wireframe I designed more options to user be able to shop easier. Otherwise I also showed user the most wanted products

### 4. PROTOTYPE

#### Low-fidelity prototype

The low-fi prototype is the primary user flow of adding an item to the cart and checking out.

Check out the Hungblomster

#### Usability study: findings

To start testing the designs, I created a low-fidelity prototype for testing.This prototype was used in an unmoderated usability study with 5 participants. Here are the main findings uncovered by the usability study
- Checkout
      *Once at the checkout screen, users didn’t see an easy way to go back the previous page*
- Button
      *Users were not able to click on the favorite flowers.*

#### Style guide

The color palette is minimal color palette which similarly featured a light dark green, black, and grey.

#### Refining the design

I made changes to improve the site’s checkout flow. One of the changes I made was adding button “back” and “cancel” if users need to change their mind. This allowed users more freedom to edit their choice without clicking on home button.

#### High-fidelity prototype

My hi-fi prototype followed the same user flow as the lo-fi prototype, and included the design changes made after the usability study.

### 5. TEST

#### Accessibility considerations

1. I used headings with different sized text for clear visual hierarchy 
2. I used breadcrums to help users navigate the site.
3. I consider using the color for accessibility

#### Takeaways

##### Impact

- Organic products community shared that they are so surprised and happy to find an organic flower store.

##### What I learned

- I have learned that by changing a small detail in the design can change the user experience and perspective. 
- The most important thing is focusing in user needs.  
- Work with what you have. You can make a sketch with a paper and a pencil to creat a story board.
- Don’t underestimate the power of wireframing and testing those wireframes. I know personally, as a new designer, I get excited and want to go straight to the colors and the fun stuff but we caught a lot of things in the low fidelity prototype that would’ve been much more difficult to fix later on.

##### Next steps

- Conduct more usability test when I want to add more functions in the website.
- I want to continue to work on user research skills to improve my ability to tell a story in the designs I create and foster effective experiences in my products.
- Find and detect the users pain point in using the website.
